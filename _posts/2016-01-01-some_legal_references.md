.01 Definitions

(8) "Buffer" means a naturally vegetated area established or maintained to
protect aquatic, wetland, shoreline, and terrestrial environments from man-made
disturbances.


14.15.09 Habitat protection Areas in the Critical Area.
.01 Definitions

A. Definition "Buffer" means an existing, naturally vegetated area, or an area
established or maintained to protect aquatic, wetlands, shoreline, and
terrestrial environments from man-made disturbances.

B. Policies. In developing their Critical Area Programs, local jurisdictions 
shall use the following policies with regard to the Buffer:

  (1) Provide for the removal or reduction of sediments, nutrients, and potentially harmful or toxic substances in run-off entering the Bay and its tributaries;

  (2) Minimize the adverse effects of human activities on wetlands, shorelines, stream banks, tidal waters, and aquatic resources;

  (3) Maintain an area of transitional habitat between aquatic and upland communities;

  (4) Maintain the natural environment of streams; and

  (5) Protect riparian wildlife habitat.

C. Criteria. In developing their Critical Area Programs, local jurisdictions
shall use all of the following criteria:

...

(7) As part of the local Critical Area Program to be submitted to the
Commission, local jurisdictions may re- quest an exemption of certain portions
of the Critical Area from the Buffer requirements where it can be sufficiently
demonstrated that the existing pattern of residential, industrial, commercial,
or recreational development in the Critical Area prevents the Buffer from
fulfilling the functions stated in §B above. If an exemption is requested,
local jurisdictions shall propose other measures for achieving the water
quality and habitat protection objectives of the policies.

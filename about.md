This site is dedicated to the dissemination of information about the Critical
Area Buffer of the State of Maryland with emphasis on Anne Arundel County.

The Critical Area is generally the region within 1000ft of mean high water of the Chesapeake Bay. States may vary in the regulations that apply to the Critical Area, and local jurisdictions within the state may implement policies that overlay the Critical Area regulations. This site focuses on the Critical Area of Anne Arundel County and is mostly concerned with providing information about the buffer which is generally the area within 100ft of mean high water.

Critical Area regulations have changed dramatically since their adoption in 1986. These revisions are recorded in the Maryland Register, [excerpts of which are provided here](/history.html).

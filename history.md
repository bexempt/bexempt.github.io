# The Buffer Over Time

**Note**: This list is incomplete, but does provide the overall situation. The gaps are being filled as time permits.

## 1985-06-07

The Critical Area regulations are drafted [Md. R. 12(12):1188-1206](/ViewerJS#../MarylandRegister/12_12_MdReg_1188-1206.pdf).


## 1985-09-27

Many edits to the draft regulations are presented [Md. R. 12(20):1953-1977](/ViewerJS#../MarylandRegister/12_20_MdReg_1953-1977.pdf).

## 1986-05-13

The bulk of the text proposed in [Md. R. 12(20):1953-1977](/ViewerJS#../MarylandRegister/12_20_MdReg_1953-1977.pdf) is adopted, becoming COMAR 14.15.01 [Md. R. 12(24):2352-2354](/ViewerJS#../MarylandRegister/12_24_MdReg_2352-2354.pdf).

The pertinent pieces of COMAR 14.15 are given below.

<pre>
14.15.01.01.B(8) Definitions
“Buffer” means a naturally vegetated area or vegetated area,
established of managed to protect aquatic, wetland,
shoreline, and terrestrial environments from man-made
disturbance.

14.15.01.01.B(18) Definitions

“Critical Area” means all lands and waters defined in
Natural Resources Article, §8-1807, Annotated Code of
Maryland. They include:

  (a)  All waters of and lands under the Chesapeake Bay and
       its tributaries to the head of tide as indicated on
       the State wetlands maps, and all State and private
       wetlands designated under Title 9 of the Natural
       Resources Article, Annotated Code of Maryland.

  (b)  All land and water areas within 1,000 feet beyond
       the landward boundaries of State of private wetlands
       and the heads of tides designated under Title 9 of
       the Natural Resources Articles, Annotated Code of
       Maryland.

  (c)  Modification to these areas through inclusions or
       exclusions proposed by local jurisdictions and
       approved by the Commission as specified in Natural
       Resources Article, §8-1807, Annotated Code of
       Maryland.

14.15.01.01.B(33) Definitions
“Hydrophytic vegetation” means those plants cited in
“Vascular Plant Species Occurring in Maryland Wetlands”
(Dawson, F. et al., 1985) which are described as growing in
water or on a substrate that is at least periodically
deficient in oxygen as a result of excessive water content
(plants typically found in wet habitats).

14.15.09.01.B Policies
In developing their Critical Area Programs, local
jurisdictions shall use the following policies with regard
to the Buffer:

   (1)  Provide for the removal or reduction of sediments,
        nutrients, and potentially harmful or toxic
        substances in runoff entering the Bay and its
        tributaries;
   (2)  Minimize the adverse effects of human activities on
        wetlands, shorelines, stream banks, tidal waters,
        and aquatic resources;
   (3)  Maintain an area of transitional habitat between
        aquatic and upland communities;
   (4)  Maintain the natural environment of streams; and
   (5)  Protect riparian wildlife habitat.

14.15.09.01.C(8) Buffer

As part of the local Critical Area Program to be submitted
to the Commission, local jurisdictions may request an
exemption for certain portions of the Critical Area from the
Buffer requirements where it can be sufficiently
demonstrated that the existing pattern of residential,
industrial, commercial, or recreational development in the
Critical Area prevents the Buffer from fulfilling the
functions stated in §B, above. If an exemption is
requested, local jurisdictions shall propose other measures
for achieving the water quality and habitat protection
objectives of the policies. These measures may include, but
are not limited to, public education and urban forestry
programs.

   (ii) Exists or may be established in natural vegetation to 
        protect a stream, tidal wetland, tidal waters, or 
        terrestrial environment from human disturbance.

    (i) At least 100 feet, even if that area was previously 
        disturbed by human activity; and
